        <h2>How to prepare Fufu</h2>
        <p>Fufu (or foofoo or foufou) is possibly one the most famous west African ”swallow” foods. It is a filling side dish, starchy, smooth, dense, and stretchy that is much beloved because it is delicious, simple, satisfying, and easy to prepare.</p>
        <p>Fufu is easy to make, yet so delicious. It is not eaten alone, and it is served with a form of rich and flavorful soup or stew such as Palmnut soup, okra soup, groundnut soup, or light soup.</p>

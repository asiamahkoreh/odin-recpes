        <h2>How to prepare Jollof</h2>
        <p>Fufu (or foofoo or foufou) is possibly one the most famous west African ”swallow” foods. It is a filling side dish, starchy, smooth, dense, and stretchy that is much beloved because it is delicious, simple, satisfying, and easy to prepare.</p>
        <p>Fufu is easy to make, yet so delicious. It is not eaten alone, and it is served with a form of rich and flavorful soup or stew such as Palmnut soup, okra soup, groundnut soup, or light soup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil(80 mL), plus 2 tablespoons, divided</li>
            <li>14 oz diced tomato(395 g), 2 cans</li>
            <li>6 oz tomato paste(170 g), 1 can</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon mixed dried herbs</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups long grain rice(500 g), rinsed</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water(360 mL)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
